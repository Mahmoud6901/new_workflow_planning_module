## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd workflow-planning-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

## üéØ Usage

### Uploading Shapefiles

1. **Drag and Drop**: Simply drag a shapefile (`.shp` or `.zip`) into the upload area
2. **Click to Upload**: Click the upload area and select a file from your system
3. **File Validation**: The system validates file format and size (max 10MB)
4. **Processing**: Files are processed and displayed on the map automatically

### Sketch Widget (Interactive Editing)

1. **Selection**: Click on graphics to select them (hold Ctrl for multiple selection)
2. **Vertex Editing**: Drag individual vertices to reshape lines and polygons
3. **Move Graphics**: Drag selected graphics to reposition them on the map
4. **Scale/Resize**: Use corner handles to scale and resize graphics proportionally
5. **Rotation**: Use rotation handles to rotate graphics around their center
6. **Deletion**: Press Delete key to remove selected graphics
7. **Precision Snapping**: Toggle snapping for precise vertex alignment with 15-pixel tolerance
8. **Visual Highlighting**: Yellow highlights show snap candidates during editing
9. **Undo/Redo**: Use Ctrl+Z for undo and Ctrl+Y for redo operations
10. **Visual Feedback**: Real-time status updates for all editing operations

### Line Splitting by Vertices

1. **Upload First**: Upload a shapefile containing line or polygon features
2. **Split Lines**: Click the "Split Lines by Vertices" button
3. **View Segments**: Each segment between consecutive vertices becomes a separate line
4. **Color Coding**: Segments are automatically styled with different colors for easy identification

### Map Interaction

- **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel or touch gestures to zoom in/out
- **Pan**: Click and drag to move around the map
- **Basemap Gallery**: Click the basemap icon (top-right) to change background maps

### Graphics Management

- **View Graphics**: All uploaded graphics are listed in the control panel
- **Toggle Visibility**: Click the eye icon to show/hide individual graphics
- **Clear Graphics**: Use the "Clear All Graphics" button to remove all uploaded data
- **Split Lines**: Use the "Split Lines by Vertices" button to create line segments
